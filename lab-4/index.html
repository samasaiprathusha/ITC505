        <h3>HTML abuse</h3>
        The HTML code that is provided makes careful use of fonts, sizes, colors, and spacing to improve the resume's readability and aesthetic appeal. The 'Arial' font family is used throughout the page, with a fallback to the'sans-serif' generic font. This decision improves readability by guaranteeing a clear, widely-supported typeface for the whole text area. The document's 20 pixel margins provide a uniform distance between the contents on all sides.

The entire content section is dominated by a dark blue background (#4682b4), individual article backgrounds and headers are light blue (#add8e6), and the content is dark black font (#333). For visual hierarchy, headings are colored differently: h1 is blue (#3498db), h2 is red (#e74c3c), and h3 is green (#e74c3c). The application of shadow effects, backdrop colors, and text formatting techniques like italicizing subheadings gives the content more structure and visual appeal.

Font sizes are different for each element; the main text (p) is set to 16px, h1 to 32px, h2 to 28px, and h3 to 24px. This maintains a balanced visual hierarchy and guarantees a clear separation between different areas.

In order to provide space and distinction between elements, padding and margins are used carefully. The header allows for room between itself and the text that follows, with a bottom margin of 20 pixels. An effective way to distinguish distinct portions of the resume is to give each piece a 40-pixel bottom margin. Particularly between the resume sections, the usage of horizontal rule (HR) elements facilitates visual separation even more.

A visually appealing and well-organized resume is influenced by the general color selections, font sizes, and space considerations. These design decisions seek to make the content reader-friendly and to successfully draw attention to the key information.    </article>
