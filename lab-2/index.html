        <h3>Addendum</h3>
        Using HTML code, I constructed my resume.The title of the resume is displayed in this HTML code by using the
        title tag, which is located under the Head tag.The title tag in HTML is used to define the title of a document
        and The head tag in HTML is used to define the header section of an HTML document. For the horizontal line behind the
            page header, I've used the hr tag.I used two article tags inside the body tag.In first article tag i have
            displayed the resume and in second article tag i have used addendum.To display the heads of the subsections,
            I use h1 and h2 tags. The h1 and h2 tags in HTML are heading tags used to define headings within a document.
            To display the skills and other information in a listed format, I've utilized li tags.The li tag in HTML is
            used to define list items within ordered or unordered lists.I've written paragraphs using the p tag.The p
            tag in HTML is used to define paragraphs of text. The term "p" stands for "paragraph."
